# OpenFoldRNA [WIP]
A novel approach to RNA folding with OpenFold

# Documentation
So far, OpenFoldRNA uses the same documentation as [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold). Follow the same installation and setup instructions there.

# Usage
While not in proper working order yet, OpenFoldRNA can be trained by running ```python train_openfoldRNA.py \ \``` from the root directory.
